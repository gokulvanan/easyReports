Couple of points from stackoverflow to consider while making changes to server/cluster code:
If you have enough load to care about multiple cores, then you are going to want to do a few more things too:

Run your Node.js service behind a web-proxy like Nginx or Apache - something that can do connection throttling (unless you want overload conditions to bring the box down completely), rewrite URLs, serve static content, and proxy other sub-services.

Periodically recycle your worker processes. For a long-running process, even a small memory leak will eventually add up.

Setup log collection / monitoring
